<h2><a href="latency-benchmark.html">Run benchmark</a></h2>

<p>This benchmark measures end-to-end latency: that is, the time between when an input event (such as a mouse click) is received by the browser, and when the browser responds by drawing to the screen. This is accomplished by programmatically sending input events to the browser, and polling for response via screenshot.

<p>The benchmark should work with any browser that supports the canvas tag and typed arrays. Simply load the <a href="latency-benchmark.html">test page</a> in any browser on the local machine.
